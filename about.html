    <h3>Our Cause</h3>
    <p>Stray Streets champions the rights of feral cats. Just because most are unadoptable doesn’t mean they’re not deserving of care and support. Feral cats face a host of issues, such as unstable populations, stressful mating behaviors, and the threat of euthanization. For years the solution to the growth of feral cat populations was capture and kill, but this has failed to solve the problem. Stray Streets seeks to educate the public with effective solutions that allow cat communties to thrive while also preventing population instability.</p>

                <h3>Feral cats are healthy.</h3>
                <p>Contrary to popular stigmas, outdoor cats can be just as healthy as indoor pet cats. Despite the near 100% mortality rate for feral shelter cats, some groups still believe it’s more cruel to leave a cat outside than take it to a shelter. Rabies, another leading argument against outdoor cats,  is mainly found in wildlife populations, not cat communities. Cats have lived thousands of years outdoors, and with proper sources of food, water, and medical treatment, can continue to thrive. </p>

                <h3>TNR saves lives.</h3>
                <p>The solution to feral cat population growth is simple: TNR, or Trap-Neuter-Return. TNR allows feral cats to be humanely taken to a veterinarian to be neutered or spayed, recieve proper vaccinations, and become ear-tipped, the universal symbol of a neutered and vaccinated cat.  This method stabilizes cat populations, keeps them healthy for years to come, and reduces stressful mating behaviors. TNR is supported by organizations such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS).</p>
